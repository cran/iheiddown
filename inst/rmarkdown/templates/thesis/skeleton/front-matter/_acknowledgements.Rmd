This is where you normally thank your advisor, colleagues, family and friends, as well as funding and institutional support. 
In our case, we will acknowledge here those who developed the ideas and tools that allow us to push open science a little step further 
by writing plain-text, transparent, and reproducible theses in *RMarkdown*. 

First, we thank Leslie Lamport for originally creating \LaTeX\, 
and Frank Mittelbach, Chris Rowley, and Rainer Sch√∂pf for their ongoing development.
Thank you to John Gruber for inventing the original version of Markdown, 
to John MacFarlane for creating Pandoc (<http://pandoc.org>), 
which converts Markdown to a large number of output formats including \LaTeX\.

Next, we are grateful to Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman from the University of Auckland for developing **R** 
from John Chambers' **S** programming language.
**R** is used to 
Thank you also to JJ Allaire, the founder and CEO of [RStudio](http://rstudio.com), 
and Hadley Wickham, mastermind of the `tidyverse` suite of packages,
without which we'd all just given up and done data science in Python instead.

Lastly, thank you to Yihui Xie for creating 
`knitr` which introduced *RMarkdown* as a way of embedding code in Markdown documents, 
and `bookdown` which added tools for technical and longer-form writing.
[Chester Ismay](http://chester.rbind.io) created the `thesisdown` package which,
together with `rticles` and `memor`, served as inspiration for this package. 
And special thanks to Ulrik Lyngs, 
who converted John McManigle and Sam Evans' adaptations of Keith Gillow's original \LaTeX\ template for writing an Oxford University DPhil thesis 
into an `oxforddown` *RMarkdown* template that serves as the basis for this skeleton.

These enormous contributions make theses and dissertations easier to write, share, and replicate.
