Package: iheiddown
Title: For Writing Graduate Institute Geneva Documents
Description: A set of tools to support writing various documents
    according to the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies 
    conventions and regulations.
    The most common use will be for writing and compiling theses or thesis chapters,
    as drafts or for examination with all the correct preamble content.
    However, the package also offers the creation of html presentation slides via 'xaringan',
    and, for course instructors, also the ability to create a syllabus as a PDF.
    The package includes additional functions for institutional color palettes
    and an institutional 'ggplot' theme, as well as a function for word counts.
